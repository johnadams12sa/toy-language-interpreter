# toy-language-interpreter
A simple language with lexing and parsing capabilities using the RPLY library, a port of PLY. Only supports basic arithmetic operations and assignments on numbers. 

EDIT
Arithmetic operations may be broken after the addition of the assignment class in parser.py
Fix is coming soon!

If using Python 3
